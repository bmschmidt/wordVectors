Title: Tools for creating and analyzing vector-space models of texts
Version: 2.0
Author: Ben Schmidt, Jian Li
Maintainer: Ben Schmidt <bmschmidt@gmail.com>
Description:
	wordVectors wraps Google's implementation in C for training word2vec models,
	and provides several R functions for exploratory data analysis of word2vec
	and other related models. These include import-export from the binary format,
	some useful linear algebra operations missing from R, and a streamlined
	syntax for working with models and performing vector arithmetic that make it
	easier to perform useful operations in a word-vector space.
