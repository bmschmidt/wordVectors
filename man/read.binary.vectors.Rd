\usage{
read.binary.vectors(filename, nrows = Inf, cols = "All",
  rowname_list = NULL, rowname_regexp = NULL, show_by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A file in the binary word2vec format to import.}

\item{nrows}{Optionally, a number of rows to stop reading after.
Word2vec sorts by frequency, so limiting to the first 1000 rows will
give the thousand most-common words; it can be useful not to load
the whole matrix into memory. This limit is applied BEFORE `name_list` and
`name_regexp`.}

\item{cols}{The column numbers to read. Default is "All";
if you are in a memory-limited environment,
you can limit the number of columns you read in by giving a vector of column integers}

\item{rowname_list}{A whitelist of words. If you wish to read in only a few dozen words,
all other rows will be skipped and only these read in.}

\item{rowname_regexp}{A regular expression specifying a pattern for rows to read in. Row
names matching that pattern will be included in the read; all others will be skipped.}

\item{show_by}{Progress bar will show every this percentage}
}
\value{
A VectorSpaceModel object
}
