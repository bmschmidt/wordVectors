\title{Read VectorSpaceModel}
\usage{
read.vectors(filename, vectors = guess_n_cols(), binary = NULL,
  show_by = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The file to read in.}

\item{vectors}{The number of dimensions word2vec calculated. Imputed automatically if not specified.}

\item{binary}{Read in the binary word2vec form. (Wraps `read.binary.vectors`) By default, function
guesses based on file suffix.}

\item{show_by}{Progress bar will show every this percentage}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to read.table or read.binary.vectors.
Note that both accept 'nrows' as an argument. Word2vec produces
by default frequency sorted output. Therefore 'read.vectors("file.bin", nrows=500)', for example,
will return the vectors for the top 500 words. This can be useful on machines with limited
memory.}
}
\value{
An matrixlike object of class `VectorSpaceModel`
}
\description{
Read a VectorSpaceModel from a file exported from word2vec or a similar output format.
}
